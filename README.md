# MiniGlanlf

Mini Glanlf is a 3D golf game with oak trees and acorns!

Take the control of GG, the golden acorn, and grow trees along your way to reach the golden pot by following the music. Moving when you are an acorn is not simple: you will be able to control the growth of an oak tree to take some altitude, and drop GG from the tip of a branch to progress further in the level. Your secondary objective is to reach the golden pot by following the music, your primary objective is to have fun with GG! Enjoy!
